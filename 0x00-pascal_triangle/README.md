# Pascal's Triangle 

- Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of numbers named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, who studied its properties in the 17th century, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years earlier. The triangle is constructed by arranging numbers in rows such that each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.
